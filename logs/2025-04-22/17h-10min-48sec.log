They would like to do this starting at 2025-08-15T05:00:00+08:00 with 4 participants. Can you help with this request? Please let me know if this is possible, what services you can provide, and your pricing. Thank you.
2025-04-22 17:11:32,478 - INFO - [cli.py:45] - guide: Hello! Thank you for reaching out. I would be delighted to assist your clients with a sunrise hike on Mount Batur. This is indeed a popular and breathtaking experience, and I'm sure they will enjoy it.

**Details of the Sunrise Hike:**

- **Date & Time:** August 15, 2025. Given the start time of 5:00 AM, we would need to adjust the meeting time to ensure they reach the summit in time for the sunrise. Typically, we start the hike around 3:00 AM from the base.

- **Meeting Point:** The usual meeting point is at the base of Mount Batur, at the Toya Bungkah village. I can arrange a pickup from their accommodation if they are staying in the Ubud or Kintamani area.

- **Duration:** The hike generally takes about 2 hours to ascend and 1.5 hours to descend. Including time at the summit, the total duration is approximately 6 hours.

- **What's Included:**
  - Professional local guide services
  - Breakfast at the summit (usually boiled eggs, bread, and bananas)
  - Bottled water
  - Entrance fees to Kintamani area
  - Flashlights and trekking poles

- **Pricing:** The price for 4 participants would be USD 60 per person. This includes all the services mentioned above.

- **Special Requirements:** Participants should have a moderate fitness level and wear comfortable hiking shoes. Warm clothing is recommended as it can be chilly at the summit before sunrise.

- **Discounts:** Since you're booking for a group of 4, I can offer a 10% discount, bringing the price to USD 54 per person.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any special requests or considerations for your clients. I look forward to assisting with their unforgettable hiking experience on Mount Batur!

I truly value the opportunity for repeat bookings, and I'm committed to providing an exceptional experience for your clients. While I'm somewhat limited in further discounts beyond the 10%, I can certainly add value to the package in other ways.

**Added Value:**

- **Complimentary Round-trip Transportation:** I can include complimentary round-trip transportation from your clients' accommodation in the Ubud or Kintamani area to the meeting point at Toya Bungkah village. This will ensure a seamless and convenient experience for them.

- **Souvenir:** Each participant will receive a small souvenir to remember their hike, such as a locally crafted bracelet or keychain.

- **Additional Refreshments:** I can add an extra layer of refreshments, including local Balinese coffee or tea at the summit.

These additions should enhance the overall experience and offer excellent value for your clients. Please let me know if there are any other specific requests or if there is anything else I can do to assist. Looking forward to making this an unforgettable adventure for your clients!
