**Mount Batur Sunrise Hike Details:**

1. **Duration:** The hike typically lasts about 4-5 hours. This includes a 2-hour trek to the summit, time at the top to enjoy the sunrise and breakfast, and a 2-hour descent.

2. **Meeting Point:** We offer pick-up services from your client's accommodation in the Ubud area. Pick-up is usually around 2:00 AM to ensure arrival at the base by 3:30 AM. If they are staying outside Ubud, additional arrangements or charges may apply.

3. **Inclusions:**
   - Professional local guide with extensive knowledge of the area.
   - Entrance fees to Mount Batur.
   - Breakfast at the summit (usually consisting of eggs cooked in volcanic steam, bread, and fruit).
   - Drinking water.
   - Flashlights for the hike.

4. **Pricing:** Our standard rate is $85 per person, which totals $340 for 4 participants. However, I can offer a 10% discount for your group, bringing the total to $306.

5. **Special Requirements:** Participants should wear comfortable hiking shoes, a light jacket (as it can be chilly before sunrise), and bring a camera to capture the stunning views. The hike is of moderate difficulty, so a basic level of fitness is required.

6. **Additional Options:** If your clients are interested, we can also arrange for a relaxing visit to a nearby hot spring after the hike for an additional fee.

Please let me know if this aligns with your client's expectations or if there are any adjustments you would like to make. I am here to ensure they have a fantastic experience in Bali!

2025-04-22 16:08:26,619 - INFO - [cli.py:45] - assistant: Hi Made, thank you for the detailed information. To address your questions:

- The budget of $300 is for all 4 participants.
- Breakfast is to be included after the hike.
- Transportation from the accommodation is required.
- There are no specific dietary restrictions, but a mix of options for breakfast would be appreciated.

Given the budget constraints, could we possibly discuss any further discounts or adjustments to better align with the client's budget? Looking forward to your response.

To work within the $300 budget for the group, we can make a few adjustments:

1. **Pricing Adjustment:** While our standard rate for the group is $340, with the 10% discount applied, it comes to $306. I can offer a slightly larger discount of around 12%, bringing the total cost down to exactly $300. This would be our best offer to maintain the quality of service.

2. **Breakfast Options:** We can certainly provide a mix of breakfast options to cater to different preferences. Typically, the breakfast includes eggs, bread, and fruit, but we can add some local pastries or other simple items to provide variety.

3. **Transportation:** We will provide round-trip transportation from your client's accommodation, included in the adjusted price. Please ensure the accommodation details are provided in advance to coordinate pick-up efficiently.

I hope these adjustments make the offer more suitable for your client. Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any other considerations we should take into account. Looking forward to providing a memorable experience for your clients!
