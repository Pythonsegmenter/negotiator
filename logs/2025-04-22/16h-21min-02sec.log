**Sunrise Hike at Mount Batur:**

- **Meeting Point:** We'll pick up the participants from their accommodation in the Ubud area around 2:00 AM to ensure they reach the starting point by 3:30 AM. If they're staying outside Ubud, please let us know so we can adjust the pickup time accordingly.

- **Duration:** The hike generally takes about 4-5 hours. Participants should expect to return to their accommodation by 10:00 AM.

- **What's Included:**
  - Round-trip transport from the accommodation.
  - An experienced English-speaking local guide.
  - Light breakfast at the summit, including boiled eggs cooked in volcanic steam and banana sandwiches.
  - Bottled water and a flashlight for the hike.
  - Entrance fees to Mount Batur.

- **Pricing:** The standard price for this excursion is $85 per person, totaling $340 for four participants. However, I can offer a 10% discount, bringing the total to $306. This is slightly above your budget, but it includes all essential services for a safe and enjoyable experience.

- **Special Requirements:** Participants should have a moderate level of fitness and wear comfortable hiking shoes. It's also advisable to bring a warm jacket, as it can be chilly at the summit before sunrise.

Please let me know if this arrangement works for your client, or if there are any other questions or adjustments needed. We aim to provide an unforgettable experience at Mount Batur!

To accommodate your request, I can offer an additional 5% discount on the total, bringing the new total to $289. This would make it comfortably within the $300 budget. Additionally, as a token of appreciation, I can include a complimentary photo package from the trek, capturing moments at the summit, which the participants can cherish as a memory of their adventure.

I hope this adjustment and additional service meet your client's expectations. Please let me know if this works or if there are any further details or questions you have. We are looking forward to creating a memorable experience for them at Mount Batur.
