### **Mount Batur Sunrise Hike**

**Date & Time:**
- Proposed Date: August 15, 2025
- Meeting Time: The hike typically begins around 3:00 AM to ensure reaching the summit for sunrise. However, we can adjust to a slightly later start if needed, though it might affect the sunrise view.

**Meeting Point:**
- We meet at the starting point in Toya Bungkah village. Transport from your accommodation can be arranged for an additional fee based on location.

**Duration:**
- Total duration is approximately 5-6 hours, including the hike and time to enjoy the sunrise at the summit.

**What's Included:**
- Experienced local guide
- Flashlights for the trek
- Breakfast at the summit (usually includes boiled eggs, bread, and hot tea/coffee)
- Entrance fees to the Mount Batur area

**Pricing:**
- Our standard rate for the sunrise hike is $90 per person. This includes all the above services. For 4 participants, the total would be $360.

**Special Offer:**
- I can offer a 10% discount on the total price, bringing it down to $324 for the group.

**Additional Services:**
- **Transport:** If your clients are staying in Ubud, we can provide round-trip transport for an additional $20 per person. For other locations, please let me know, and I can provide a customized quote.
- **Private Tour:** If your clients prefer a private experience without other groups, please let me know, and we can arrange this for an additional fee.

**Special Requirements:**
- Participants should be in moderate physical condition, as the hike involves some steep and rocky paths.
- Comfortable walking shoes, a light jacket, and a small backpack with water are recommended.

Please let me know if this aligns with your client's needs or if there are any adjustments or additional services they might require. I'm here to help ensure they have a wonderful experience!

2025-04-22 14:25:46,958 - INFO - [cli.py:45] - Thank you for the detailed offer, Made. My client's budget is $300 for the hike, and while the services offered are comprehensive, I need to see if there's any possibility to adjust the pricing to meet their budget. Since we are quite close to the deadline, could we possibly agree on $300 for the group of four? This would help us proceed smoothly and confirm the booking. Thank you for considering this.
2025-04-22 14:25:56,080 - INFO - [cli.py:45] - Thank you for your interest and for considering our services. I understand the importance of staying within budget, and I'm happy to work with you to make this happen. While our standard offering is $360 for the group, I can extend a special discount of 15% for this booking. This would bring the total cost down to $306 for the group of four.

While this is slightly above your client‚Äôs budget, I believe the value of the experience and the inclusions will ensure a memorable and worthwhile adventure. If possible, please let me know if this adjustment can work for your clients. Additionally, if there are any specific aspects of the service that they might want to modify to better fit their budget, I‚Äôm open to discussing that as well.

Looking forward to your response and hoping we can finalize the arrangements soon!

2025-04-22 14:26:01,713 - INFO - [cli.py:45] - Hi Made, thank you for your flexibility. To align with my client's budget of $300, could we explore the possibility of adjusting certain elements of the package? Perhaps we could look at options like excluding transport if they can arrange their own or any other minor adjustments that might help us meet the budget. Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.
2025-04-22 14:26:07,442 - INFO - [cli.py:45] - Certainly! I'm more than willing to help tailor the package to fit your client's budget of $300. Here are a couple of adjustments we can make to meet the budget:

1. **Excluding Transport:**
   If your clients can arrange their own transport to the meeting point in Toya Bungkah village, we can exclude the transport service. This adjustment would typically save around $20 per person, which brings the cost down significantly.

2. **Simplified Breakfast Option:**
   We could provide a more basic breakfast option at the summit, which might save a little more on the cost.

With these adjustments, we can offer the Mount Batur Sunrise Hike for the group of four at $300 total. This way, they will still enjoy the full experience of the hike, guided by our experienced local guides, and be able to witness the breathtaking sunrise from the summit.

Please confirm if this works for your clients, and we can proceed with the booking. Let me know if there are any other specifics you would like to discuss!
