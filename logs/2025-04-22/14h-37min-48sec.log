**Mount Batur Sunrise Hike Details:**

- **Meeting Point:** Typically, we pick up participants from their accommodation within the Ubud area around 1:30 AM to 2:00 AM, depending on the exact location. If your clients are staying outside Ubud, we can arrange a different pickup point or time.

- **Duration:** The entire experience lasts about 10 hours, including travel time. The hike itself takes about 2 hours to reach the summit in time for sunrise, and another 2 hours to descend.

- **What's Included:**
  - Round-trip transportation from and to your accommodation in a comfortable vehicle.
  - An experienced local guide to lead the hike.
  - Flashlights/torches for each participant.
  - Breakfast at the summit, usually consisting of eggs boiled in the volcanic steam, bread, and fruit.
  - Entrance fees to Mount Batur.

- **Pricing:** The standard price for this tour is $85 per person, which totals $340 for 4 participants. However, I can offer a 10% discount for your group, bringing the total down to $306.

- **Requirements:** Participants should have a moderate level of fitness, as the trail can be steep and uneven in places. We recommend wearing comfortable hiking shoes and bringing a jacket, as it can be chilly at the summit before sunrise.

If the proposed schedule and pricing work for your clients, please let me know so I can reserve the spots for them. If you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with, feel free to ask!
