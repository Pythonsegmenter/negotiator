2025-04-18 16:54:27,572 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - Hey Trippy! I'm planning to hike Mount Batur at sunrise while I'm in Bali. There'll be four of us going. I wanna make sure we get the best value for the price, and I prefer a hike that's moderately difficult.
2025-04-18 16:54:31,748 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - That sounds like an amazing adventure! To help you get the best deal, could you let me know what time you'd like to start the hike? Also, do you have a specific budget in mind for this experience?
2025-04-18 16:54:32,879 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - Yeah, we're looking to start the hike pretty early, around 5 AM, to catch the sunrise. As for the budget, we're hoping to keep it under $300 for all four of us.
2025-04-18 16:54:37,743 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - That sounds like a great plan! Just to make sure we can secure the best deal for you, do you have a specific deadline by when you'd like to finalize the arrangements? And do you already have a guide in mind, or should we reach out to someone you know?
2025-04-18 16:54:39,126 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - We'd like to finalize everything by July 15th, just to be safe. I do have a couple of guides in mind, Made Wirawan and Ketut Suardana. If we can negotiate with one of them, that'd be awesome.
