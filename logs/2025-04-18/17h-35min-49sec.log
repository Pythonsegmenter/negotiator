2025-04-18 17:36:18,164 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - Hello, I am a travel agent working on behalf of a client. They are interested in: Hiking to catch the sunrise at Mount Batur. They would like to do this starting at 2024-08-15T05:00:00 with 4 participants. Their budget is 300. Can you help with this request? Please let me know if this is possible, what services you can provide, and your pricing. Thank you.
2025-04-18 17:36:27,543 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - Hello, thank you for reaching out on behalf of your client. I'd be delighted to assist with organizing a sunrise hike to Mount Batur. Here are the details of the service I can provide:

**Mount Batur Sunrise Hike Details:**

- **Meeting Point:** We arrange an early morning pickup from your client's accommodation in the Ubud area around 2:00 AM to ensure a timely arrival at the base of Mount Batur. For locations outside Ubud, please let me know, and I can provide an adjusted pickup time.

- **Hike Start Time:** The hike typically begins around 4:00 AM from the base of the mountain to allow ample time to reach the summit for the sunrise at approximately 6:00 AM.

- **Duration:** The entire experience, including transportation, hiking, and return, is approximately 8–10 hours.

- **Inclusions:**
  - Round-trip transportation from the client's accommodation.
  - Experienced local guide with detailed knowledge of the area and its history.
  - Headlamps and walking sticks for safety.
  - Light breakfast at the summit (usually includes eggs boiled in volcanic steam, bread, and hot tea or coffee).
  - Entry fees to Mount Batur.
  - Bottled water.

- **Pricing:** The regular price for this package is $90 per person. For four participants, this totals $360. However, I can offer a 10% discount for your group, bringing the total to $324.

- **Special Requirements:** Participants should be in good health and have a reasonable level of fitness as the hike can be moderately challenging. Comfortable hiking shoes and a jacket for the cooler temperatures at the summit are recommended.

If your client's budget is strictly $300, we could potentially discuss further customization, such as adjusting transportation arrangements if they have their own means of reaching the base or omitting certain inclusions.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to proceed with the booking. I look forward to assisting you further!
