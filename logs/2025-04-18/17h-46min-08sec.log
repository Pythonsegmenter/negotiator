### Mount Batur Sunrise Hike Details:

**Meeting Point:**

Given the small difference, could you possibly adjust the package to meet this budget? Perhaps there's a possibility to slightly modify the included services, like opting out of breakfast if necessary, to bring the cost down to $300. I appreciate your help in creating a memorable experience within their budget constraints.

2025-04-18 17:47:02,956 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - I completely understand your client's budget constraints, and I'm happy to work with you to create a package that meets their needs while still providing a memorable experience. To accommodate the $300 budget for the group, we can make a few adjustments:

1. **Opt-out of Breakfast:** We can exclude the breakfast at the summit, which would help reduce costs slightly.

2. **Group Pickup Point:** Instead of individual pickups, we can arrange for a single pickup point that is convenient for all participants, which can also help save on transportation costs.

3. **Reduced Group Discount:** I can extend a 12% discount instead of the usual 10%, which would bring the total cost for four participants to $299.20.

With these adjustments, we can meet your client's budget of $300 while still providing a quality experience. Let me know if this works for your client, or if there are any other preferences or questions. I‚Äôm here to help ensure they have an unforgettable sunrise hike up Mount Batur.
