2025-04-18 18:52:02,524 - INFO - [cli.py:43] - Thank you for your inquiry and your interest in collaborating with us. I completely understand the need to stay within your client's budget, and I'm here to help make this experience both memorable and feasible.

To meet the $300 budget, I can offer a couple of options:

1. **Further Discount:** I can extend a further discount, taking the total down to $310, which slightly exceeds your client's budget.

2. **Additional Value:** Alternatively, I can include a complimentary personalized photo package at the summit, capturing your client's experience at sunrise, which typically adds significant value to the tour. This could help justify the slightly higher cost.

3. **Group Sharing Option:** If your clients are open to joining a small group tour instead of a private one, we can offer a reduced rate that would fit within the $300 budget. This option would maintain all standard inclusions but would involve sharing transportation and guiding services with a few other participants.

Please let me know which option would best suit your client's needs, or if you have any other thoughts or adjustments you would like to explore. My goal is to ensure a fantastic and memorable experience for your clients at Mount Batur.
